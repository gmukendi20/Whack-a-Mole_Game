# Whack-a-Mole_Game
Whack-a-Mole is an arcade game where players use a mallet to hit moles popping out of holes. Moles appear randomly for a short time, and the player must hit them before they retreat. Each successful hit scores points, and the game becomes faster and more challenging as it progresses. The objective is to score as many points as possible within the time limit.
